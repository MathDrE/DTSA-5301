Final Project
"Final Project 1: Video Presentation and Document on Github"
Create a video in .mp4 format in which you present your "NYPD Shooting Incident Data Report" in ten minutes or less. The project should be NYPD Shooting Incident Data (Historic) from the website:https://catalog.data.gov/datase
Be sure to use the presentation skills we discussed in the lectures such as organization, key visualizations, eye contact, and tell a story. Make it interesting to listen and watch.
Put your reproducible .rmd document in your Github account and provide a link to that document. Your peers should be able to download and knit your document without errors. 
If you use any libraries not used in class, please make sure that is known at the top of your document.
